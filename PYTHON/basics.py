# This is a Comment
'''
Since Python will ignore string literals that are not assigned to a variable, 
you can add a multiline string (triple quotes) in your code, and place your comment inside it:
This is a comment
written in
more than just one line

A variable can have a short name (like x and y) or a more descriptive name (age, carname, total_volume). Rules:
- A variable name must start with a letter or the underscore character
- A variable name cannot start with a number
- A variable name can only contain alpha-numeric characters and underscores (A-z, 0-9, and _ )
- Variable names are case-sensitive (age, Age and AGE are three different variables)

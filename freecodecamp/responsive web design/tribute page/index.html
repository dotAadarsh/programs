          In 1894, Sir Oliver Lodge first demonstrated waveguide microwave
          transmission lines at London's Royal Institution. Three years later at
          the University of Calcutta, Indian physicist J.C. Bose (seen here)
          flared out the end of a waveguide, demonstrating the horn antenna

        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>1894 - 1899: </strong>Created radio-waves as short as 5mm.
            Such waves are now better known as microwaves and are used in
            radars, ground and satellite communication, remote sensing and
            microwave ovens. Also devised a portable apparatus (10" x 12") for
            the study of their optical properties. It had the earliest waveguide
            and horn antenna of todayâ€™s microwave engineering.

        </ul>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>1899 - 1902: </strong>Initiated detailed study of coherer
            leading to his discovery of the common nature of the electrical
            response to all forms of stimulation, in animal and plant tissues as
            well as in some inorganic models. In 1900, his paper titled "On the
            Similarity of Responses in Inorganic and Living Matter" at the
            International Congress of Physics, Paris garnered huge appreciation.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>1902 - 1907: </strong>He continued efforts to device
            inorganic models of the biophysical phenomena underlying electrical
            and mechanical responses to stimulation, the transmission of
            excitation in plant and animal tissues and of vision and memory.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>1907 - 1933: </strong>During this period he devoted himself
            mainly to the study of response phenomena in plants, the complexity
            of whose responses lies intermediate between those of inorganic
            matter and animals.
